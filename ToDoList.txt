Let's see if this line can be pushed to github :)

This seems to be working, however the other commits disappear :( perhaps the reason is because I'm only updating the ToDoList.txt and github updates the same file too and
hence drops the commits because of it?

or perhaps because I am doing something wrong, let's see by adding a new file to be committed to my github playground. fingers crossed it goes well.

The readme.md stays on the first commit, as expected, but the ToDoList.txt as well as the testFile.txt change to fifth commit. After some digging around on the github page
I finally understand what is happening. On the "homepage" of my github page it shows all the files and the last commit of each file. Digging into the "Insight" tab I am
able to find the other commits and what exactly has changed, phew :)

Although, now for some reason it seems like my git bash has "crashed" after I checked the logs (it looped the log request a couple of times) and I can't seem to continue and
add "code requests" to bash - this happened last week too :(

pressing Q for some reason helped, was I somehow in a sub program of git and pressing Q quit it and returned me to the normal git bash again?
or did it quit the endless loop of logs it was creating, something to remember for the future - when git seems "stuck" try pressing the Q button.

why is there a kdg file in my local repository though?
