Let's see if this line can be pushed to github :)

This seems to be working, however the other commits disappear :( perhaps the reason is because I'm only updating the ToDoList.txt and github updates the same file too and
hence drops the commits because of it?

or perhaps because I am doing something wrong, let's see by adding a new file to be committed to my github playground. fingers crossed it goes well
